Configuration / FAQ
=======

You will find all configurable options inside `config/config.default.php`,
all of which can be set in your `config/config.php` file. 
By default, guest users can't view your movie collection. If you want guest
users to view your collection, set the `guestview` variable to `true` in
`config/config.php` after installation or upgrade.

### SEO Friendly URL (pretty_url)

Activate inside `config/config.default.php` or `config/config.php` and read
the instructions inside .htaccess.

### Age rating / Parental Guidance / MPAA

Activate inside `config/parental.guidance.php` or `config/config.php` and read
the instructions inside `config/parental.guidance.php`.

### Configure languages
#### Tell IMDb which is the preferred language (e.g. en-US, de-DE, pt-BR)
Sometimes IMDb gets unsure that the specified language are correct, if you only specify your unique language and territory code (de-DE). In the example below, you can find that we have chosen to include `de-DE (German, Germany)`, `de (German)` and `en (English)`. If IMDb canâ€™t find anything matching German, Germany, you will get German results instead or English if there are no German translation.
```
$settings["imdbphp"]["language"] = 'de-DE,de,en';
```
Please use The Unicode Consortium [Langugage-Territory Information](http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/language_territory_information.html) database for finding your unique language and territory code.

| Language | Code | Territory   | Code |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | ---- |
| German   | de   | Germany {O} | DE   |

After you have found your unique language and territory code you will need to combine them. Start with language code (de), add a separator (-) and at last your territory code (DE); `de-DE`. Now include your language code (de); `de-DE,de`. And the last step add English (en); `de-DE,de,en`.

#### Change geolocation
Sometimes your server aren't located in your preferred area (language), so you can use another ip address (e.g. a public proxy), for tricking IMDb geolocation system.
There are some movies/TV Series that have the English translation in "World-wide" and the only way to retrieve them is an US/UK IP-address.
```
$settings["imdbphp"]["ip_address"] = '';
```

### Keyboard shortcuts
- CTRL+F, CMD+F or F3
  - Focus search field
- DELETE (in search field)
  - Removes text in search field
- END (in search field)
  - Reset everything (except: sort by, results per page and layout)

### Internal Server Error

Try to run the website, but if the site failes opening with a `Internal 
Server Error`, adjust the .htaccess file in the root of the site.
Try to remove the Options line by placing a # at the beginning of the line.
Otherwise remove the `<Files>` section. These settings might fail because of
the permissions of your webserver.

### SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
Visible as ERROR 500 in your browser when adding movie/tv posters from IMDb.
#### Windows
1. [Download cacert.pem](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html).  
2. Store it somewhere on your server.  
`C:\php\extras\ssl\cacert.pem`  
3. Open your php.ini and add the following under `[curl]`.  
`curl.cainfo = "C:\php\extras\ssl\cacert.pem"`  
4. Restart your web server.

#### Linux
I recommend that you update your local `ca-bundle.crt` or `ca-certificates.crt` file for your whole system.  
There are different best practices depending on OS. Google is your best bet, for finding the safest way.  

You can also use a local `cacert.pem` like in Windows.  
```
/etc/ssl/certs/cacert.pem  
curl.cainfo = "/etc/ssl/certs/cacert.pem"
```
    
Templates
=======

You can customize your site by adding your own template. Take a look at the
`tpl/default/` directory and copy this directory to your own tpl directory.
Now you can adjust the `config/config.php` to your new template. Check all 
template files and try to adjust them to your own whishes.

If you just want to change the color, please check `config/config.defaults.php` for available skins.
